									Hi, I'm Denise Bartolome. I live and work in the San Francisco bay area. Currently, I work as the Assistant to the Principal Civil Engineer at GHD, working on strategy and business development with a variety of tasks. I double majored in English and IT at Penn State because I have seen how technology can bring people closer to one another and I want to help make these kinds of moments happen.</p>
									
									<p>
									When I'm not working, I like to read, go on long runs, play guitar or violin, and write letters for snail mail. </p>

					<p>
					The LAS degree within The College of Liberal Arts requires a degree proposal submission process from all of its students. With this site, the submissions went from the traditional mailing system to an online submission. The following is my list of actions as creator of the site:
					<ul>
					<li>Chose the technology: I researched possible solutions and went with a combination of WordPress and Penn State's Angel CMS.
					<li>Rethought the needs of LAS: We decided to make profile pages of staff and peers in order to address another issue within LAS: lack of relationship between students and staff since LAS is an online degree.
					<li>Gathered content: I attended meetings with World Campus university advisers to get people on the same page about the plan for the degree proposal process. I also communicated with advisers and potential mentors on a weekly basis in order to gather autobiographies, pictures, and other content. I took photos around campus and used one for the center display in the homepage. 
					<li>Created: I used HTML and CSS to build the website out of the pre-packaged WordPress service for Penn State faculty and students (sites.psu.edu). This was actually the easiest part of the project. 
					<li>Presented: I attended and presented the website to a panel of university world campus coordinators and directors.
					</ul>

					For five years, this blog has served to help others analyze chosen lines from books, movies, and songs. Some noteable projects include reflections on Noli Me Tangere by Jose Rizal, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and music by Ryan Adams.

					<strong>Lector Book club</strong> |
					<a href="http://www.lectorbookclub.com/"> lectorbookclub.com</a>
					<p>
					I currently work on a project called Lector, an online book club that seeks to connect readers with meaningful reflections. The site runs in conjunction with classes such as ENGL 30 (Intro to Rhetoric) and ENGL 202B (Writing in the Humanities). Books that are discussed include Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell and JFKâ€™s Last Hundred Days by Thurston Clarke. For this project, I am in charge of redesigning Lector so that it is more usable. 
					<ul>
					<li>Redesigned to clean layout: There were many navigation bars and sharing links on the site which made for a cluttered look. This called for some wireframing in order to assess what content was actually needed. I also edited some formats to get rid of unwanted white space. 
					<li>Rethought the links: I worked with a lecturer to simplify the main links for the site. 
					<li>Managed users: I invite and aid the students who post on this website. 
					<li>Content Edited: I reviewed the Home and About page to revise as needed. 
					</ul>

					<p>
					When I was younger, I liked to "publish a newspaper" every Sunday morning. I wanted to dress up real news so I turned them into mad libs. 
					<ul>
					<li> I chose a rant because rants tend to have repetition in choice words.
					<li> Pinpointed specific words in the article that can be changed for a "funny" effect.  
					<li> Created a simple, minimalist website layout using HTML and CSS. I just used Notepad to write the code. I also created a form using HTML. 
					<li> Created a Javascript file that would gather the text inputs from the form to turn into string variables. 
					<li> Researched for cheap or free hosting and domain names. 
					</ul>
